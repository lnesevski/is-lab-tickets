### Luka Neshevski 181505
# Integrated Systems - Lab 01
## Movie Tickets App

This is my solution for the lab/homework for Integrated Systems 2021.

#### Notes:
- The database is backed up in this repository as `MovieTickets181505.bak` (NOT to be confused with ~~`MovieTickets181505.sln`~~).
- The `registered users.txt` file contains two users from each Role, which are already in the database.
- The `usrs.xlsx` is for uploading users via the `Import Users` feature from the `Administrator` role.
- Check `appsettings.json` in `MovieTickets.Web` in order to properly connect the database.
